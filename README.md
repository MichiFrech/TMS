## Our software aims
<p>
Make project management easier and more efficient. The application will make large pin boards in companies useless because it will make everything digital and meetings
won't be neccessary too. It doesn't matter where your are, our software provides world wide access thanks to the internet. Since the admin can ssign people to every
task everybody knows what and until when it has to be finished. Working together was never easier!
